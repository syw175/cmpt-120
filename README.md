# CMPT 120 - Introduction to Computing Science and Programming I (Python) 
This repository contains all my CMPT120 work and assignments for Spring 2022. The course is taught in Python and covers topics such as pseudocode; data types and control structures; fundamental algorithms; recursion; reading and writing files; measuring performance of algorithms; debugging tools; basic terminal navigation using shell commands. 

Note that some exercises may not be the most efficient solution. Feel free to ask questions or post feedback via the issues tab.
